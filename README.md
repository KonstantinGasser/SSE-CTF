# Lecture: SSE (Secure Software Engineering)
Idea after learning how to build secure software and the processes and mechanisims behind that we build our own "app".
Here we documented how we build the software, what we did to ensure security issues were tested and documented. `However` we should also include 5 `bug` or `security` issues so the teams afterwards could hack each other :o. 
 Our security issues:
- missconfiguration -> leftover dev route to add users
- missconfiguration -> directory traversal
- SQL-Injection -> query to search for grades
- XSS -> in comment a prof could set while setting a grade for a student
